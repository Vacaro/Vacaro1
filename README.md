# Description
**Vacaro Game Engine** is a multi-purpose *game* and *media* engine which powers Games and other 3D related content. Written from the ground up using modern toolkits and programming languages, the Vacaro Engine provides intuitive and easy-to-use API toolkits for the developer and artists to unleash their creativity. No matter the skillset, Vacaro provides easy-to-use documentation and tutorials available on the GitHub page or in the Launcher.

> **Warning**
> *Vacaro* is in early development, the *codebase* and *API* can change rapidly.

> **Note**
> Any [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) based projects use [*NPM*](https://npmjs.org) package manager.
