## Installation
> [!TIP]
> You can make a `ZMANN` folder inside of your VST3 folder to keep your ZMANN plugins all in one place.

After downloading the latest release, extract the contents of the zip file to your VST3 folder. <!-- If you don't know where your VST3 folder is, -->

## Building
> [!WARNING]  
> As of writing, only Windows is supported for building. Linux cross-compilation might work, but is not stable at this time. [Read more about cross-compilation](#cross-compiling).
### Prerequisites
- [Moonrepo](https://moonrepo.dev/docs/install#windows)
- [Node.js 18.17](https://nodejs.org/en/) or later
- [rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

ZMANN uses Moonrepo as its build tooling, make sure to install it before continuing.
Once installed, make sure that rustup is installed with **msvc** if building on Windows:
```bash
$ rustup default stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
```

### Building the plugins
Plugins are required to be built separately from each other. Run the *moon* command with the [plugin name](#plugins) and `:build` at the end to target a release build. For example:
```bash
$ moon toybox_c1200:build
```
Moonrepo will now build the `toybox_c1200_ui` before building the plugin itself. After successfully building, each plugin will make their own *.vst3* bundle inside of the `/target/bundled/` folder. 

Optionally by running `./scripts/link-bundled-to-dev.cmd` on Windows, a simlink will be created from the locally generated artifacts folder to the standard vst3 folder to streamline development.

### Cross-Compiling
#### Debian/Ubuntu
Make sure to install the following package and toolchain:
```sh
$ sudo apt install build-essential
$ rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
```
After installing the toolchain, modify [.cargo/config.toml](.cargo/config.toml) to use the `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` toolchain:
```toml
[alias]
xtask = "run --package xtask --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu --release --"
```
Finally, you can build the plugins by running the following command:
```bash
$ moon plugin_name:build
```
